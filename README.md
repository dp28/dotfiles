# Dotfiles

A rewrite of my old dotfiles so that some aspects can be shared and other
(domain-specific) areas can be maintained separately. The aim is to have a set
of dotfiles that are quick and easy to add to, while also being self-documented
(so that I can remember how to use commands I don't use very frequently).

## Commands
### `dotfiles` (or `dfs`)
Re-sources the dotfiles directory
